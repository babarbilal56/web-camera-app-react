# Mobile Camera development

### TO GET STARTED:

1. Run the following command in the terminal to clone the repo to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ehdevgit/camera_webapp.git
    ```
   Make sure to run this in a new folder on your local machine.

2. Install the dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
   This might take a bit, but it's for the libraries we will be using for this project.
   
  


### WHERE TO START

- **MobileView.tsx**: This is the main page you will be working in. Feel free to make new `.tsx` components, but this will be the main one for editing the view. Make sure to add dynamic functionality for when the user is viewing from the web or mobile view. You will see starter code for exmaples of what the tailwind looks like, but reference the other tailwind config files for more details. To test on mobile, use the mobile view in the Chrome dev tools.

- **Add new files**: If you want to add any new components, make sure to add a route to that in `App.tsx`.

### HOW TO START THE PROJECT
This command will start the program using webpack and host on "localhost:8080" so make sure you 
        do not having any current running processes on the same port.
Run:
```bash
npm start
